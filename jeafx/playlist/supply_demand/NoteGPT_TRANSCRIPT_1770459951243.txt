supply and demand a simple Market concept that can be used as the foundation behind a highly profitable trading strategy but like most trading Concepts a lot of people get it wrong in the next few minutes I'm going to show you how you can Master supply and demand trading so that you can start building out a winning system so stick around and I'll give you everything you're going to need what is supply and demand it's a concept that allows us to determine areas of strong buying or selling using

00:00:26
zones this is a supply Zone and this is a demand zone so supply and demand zones show prices that large buyers or sellers were happy to pay for an asset it's seen as a consolidation or piece of sideways price action before a big up or down move and what it's showing is an area where the buyers or sellers collected orders before actually releasing those orders to the market which is where the big high momentum move kicks in here's a simple supply and demand equation when demand is up Supply is down and when

00:00:53
demand is down Supply is up high demand leads to Rising prices and high Supply leads to Falling prices why because the market is an auction if a lot of people are willing to bid at the current price for an asset people will ask more for the purchase if everyone wants what you have however you can ask for more in return When demand is low there are a lot of units readily available to be sold to the market but not enough buyers willing to pay a premium price so the market has to fall into place to meet

00:01:20
the buyer demands when we can successfully mark up zones and understand what they're telling us we can get some really great entries for app positions leading to high risk reward and high accuracy tra so how do we mark up supply and demand zones on our charts marking supply and demand is very important if you mark it incorrectly you'll mess up your entire strategy from the beginning but if you do it right you'll be able to get sniper entries like this this and this now there's a commonly known way to Mark

00:01:46
supply and demand most people use the last down candle before the up move like this and the last up candle before the down move like this now this works fine and is a good general rule but personally I do it a little bit differently I Mark supply and demand based on the last candle before the impulse aka the last candle before the big move up or down this makes more sense to me from a logical perspective because I'm actually looking at the direct area where the massive buying or selling came from also most of the time

00:02:13
it gives me more refined entries so I can get in with smaller stop losses to maximize my reward on each trade and one more note the supply or demand Zone always has to be imbalanced if it doesn't have an imbalance leading into it it's not a zone I'm interested in trading at all it's important that you always trade with the trend if you you don't understand Trends watch this video it's on Market structure that's going to explain everything to you there's a card somewhere in the top corner of this

video when you go to your charts you'll realize there seemingly supply and demand zones everywhere and much like all other Market Concepts if you can't Define which zones matter and which ones don't you'll soon be left with a chart clouded with random boxes that you can't make sense of and this will do more harm than good a very simple but very important rule is to always trade Supply or Demand with the trend Supply is selling and demand is buying this simple tip will eradicate half of the zones and

00:03:01

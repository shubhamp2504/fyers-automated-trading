one thing that many Traders struggle with when trading supply and demand or smart money Concepts is finding the right Zone to buy or sell from sometimes in trending markets price action is going to form multiple Supply or demand zones and you're not going to be sure which one you should focus on failing to know which zones to focus on and which zones to ignore leads to a lot of avoidable losses because Traders will try and execute from the wrong zone or even worse from every Zone this can cause two three or sometimes even more

00:00:26
losses before you actually get it right and that is not a situation that we want to get into so how do you actually identify which is the best Zone to buy from that's what I'm going to help you with here today we're going to be talking through four primary points to help you perfectly select the zones you should be focusing on and the zones that you should be ignoring thought number one is a Zone efficient inefficiency or efficiency in a market generally refers to whether a Zone has been retested or

00:00:50
not a couple examples efficient markets look like this where all zones have been retested and inefficient markets look like this where zones are left without retests I I see some people trying to trade out of Supply or demand zones that have already been retested by Wicks or full bodies these zones are low probability why because any buying or selling orders at these levels have already been met the orders have been filled it's the areas with inefficiencies or imbalances that are likely to be filled and likely to give

00:01:18
the best reactions because the buying or selling orders inside of these zones are still waiting for a fill so the first step I have for you when it comes to choosing zones is to focus on the imbalanced zones to identify an imbalanced Zone we are simply looking for Supply or demand zones that have caused a big move that haven't yet been filled so we don't want to see any Wix bodies or anything else trading back into that zone example these zones are imbalanced this one is not but sometimes

00:01:43
you're going to see multiple imbalanced zones so that leads me on to the second point point number two extreme zones so in a price move like this which is quite a common sight we are left with multiple imbalanced zones in these instances we have more than one possible point to trade from which can get a bit tricky but as a general rule that will treat you well imbalance extreme zones hold a lot of weight an extreme zone is simply a term for the furthest imbalance Zone from Price within the current leg of

00:02:08
movement so these are standard zones and this is an extreme Zone in situations with multiple imbalance zones it's very likely and very possible the market is going to come and trade into the low Zone because we still have imbalance and inefficiency to fill now this isn't going to happen every single time and to combat that we can approach from two angles buy or sell limits at the extreme zones and a focus on confirmation entries at any of zones in the move a confirmation entry for me just looks

00:02:33
like this where we wait for price to meet our Zone and then look for a shift in the smaller trend from lower lows and lower highs into higher highs higher lows then we know the small Trend agrees with the big Trend and our probability and likelihood of winning goes up a lot so I tend to prefer extreme zones for my buy or sells especially if I'm using a limit order because it greatly increases your risk versus reward and also increases the likelihood that the trade wins remember though trading is a

00:02:56
probability-based industry and sometimes by focusing only on extr exam zones you will miss trades that's the nature of the game and that's where the confirmation entries come in handy the third thought is the strength of the impulse in a trend we have Corrections and impulses the impulse moves are the large movements in line with the trend and the corrections are these little pullbacks against the trend if a Zone has formed a strong impulse so a movement something like this that is going to be a high probability Zone to

00:03:23
buy from if however a Zone has formed a very slow choppy bit of price action on the way up but then we come in and we form a strong impulse Zone like this then the second zone is going to be the one with the higher probability and while this does somewhat contradict the previous point on Extreme zones the simple tip I can give you to take advantage of this thought is to focus on the strong impulses when they are the cause of the break of structure so in this example of a trade I took a while back we see there are open imbalances

00:03:46
below but they are weaker zones because the moves they caused are slow choppy and all inside of the previous structure move then we have a strong impulse and this impulse breaks the trend into new highs so while this isn't exactly the extreme Zone it's definitely the Zone where the most buying pressure came from therefore being the Zone with the most interest and the final pointer is does your Zone exist on the higher time frame depending on how long you've been trading by now you might already know

00:04:10
that the higher time frames generally provide the more accurate setups why less falce moves and less intermittent noise High time frames show price action averaged out low time frames show every little intricacy of the buying and selling that takes place within so a mistake that Traders make is looking too low if you're looking at a trend that is visible on the 4-Hour time frame but you're only looking at the 5 or 15 minutes zones or trades then you might be missing important information take

00:04:33
this trade for example we can clearly see here that there are a bunch of small zones and now we are left wondering which zone is the right one to buy from well if we just jump up to the 4-Hour time frame we'll actually see that only one of the zones sits within a major area so because the high time frame gives a clearer picture we could put our focus on this Zone as the highest probability point to trade from this simplifies the trade down to one clear Zone cuts out a lot of silly losses and

00:04:56
gives us a very high probability point to execute from increasing the likelihood that we win on this trade and therefore if we do it enough increasing our Baseline win loss ratio over time all in all the key points to focus on are IM balances extreme zones momentum or the strength of impulse and using the higher time frames to determine whether a zone is high probability or not if you put these points into action you'll be able to trade with more clarity avoid silly little losses and catch higher
